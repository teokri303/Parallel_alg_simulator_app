## Overview

**Sorting Easy** is a gamelike web application that visualizes two key parallel sorting algorithms on 2D meshes: **Shearsort** and the **Schnorr-Shamir algorithm**. It provides a graphical and interactive environment for students and educators to explore parallel computation concepts. The app is fully responsive, accessible, and can be used on any device. 

You can access it easily on [Sorting Easy](https://sortingeasy.netlify.app)).

## Features
- **📱 Fully Responsive**: Works seamlessly across all devices—desktop, tablet, and mobile.
- **🔍 Interactive Visualization**: Create and fill 2D meshes manually or automatically, then execute and observe sorting algorithms step-by-step.
- **🚀 Parallel Execution**: The algorithms run in parallel using JavaScript Web Workers, improving performance and providing a true parallel computation experience.
- **🕹️ Step-by-Step Navigation**: Explore each step of the algorithms with detailed explanations.
- **♿ Accessibility**: Integrated with UserWay to ensure accessibility for all users.


## Technologies Used 🛠️
- **⚛️ React.js**: Interactive UI and management of dynamic content.
- **JavaScript**: Core programming language for functionality, including the use of Web Workers for parallel execution.
