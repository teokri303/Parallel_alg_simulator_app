    "shear text" : "Shearshort is a mesh parallel sorting algorithm that organizes elements in phases. It alternates between sorting rows towards the right or left and sorting columns downward. Rows are first sorted in alternating directions, creating a partially sorted mesh horizontally. Then, all columns are sorted downward in subsequent phases, refining the order. This process repeats until the entire mesh is sorted.",
    "ss text" :  "The parallel sorting algorithm of Schnorr and Shamir for large meshes. This algorithm efficiently sorts N items into a snakelike order using a multi-phase approach (8 phases). It divides the mesh into blocks, sorts them in snakelike order, performs column unshuffling, and conducts additional sorting phases. Phases 1, 3, 5, and 6 can all be accomplished using the Shearsort algorithm.",

    "how to use": "First select the parallel sorting algorithm (Shearsort or Schnorr-Shamir algorithm) you wish to apply by clicking on its box. Then, within the selected box, define and visualize the mesh: select its dimension by the dropdwn menu, either fill it automatically with random 0/1 values or fill in your own 0/1 values and click Show array to view. By clicking Sort, you see the algorithm running.",
    "leema": "Both algorithms correctly sort every input sequence. However, all input sequences - no matter what their exact values are - can alwyas be mapped to an appropriately generated sequence of zeros and ones which are visualized here as white and black cells, respectively." ,
    "mesh enclosures reshape": "Shearsort is a good choice for small meshes while for big meshes the algorithm by Schnorr-Shamir runs faster deploying a more sophisticated breakdown of the mesh into blocks. As you will probably notice, sometimes your mesh is embedded into a bigger one for facilitating the mesh breakdown into appropriate blocks.",
    "the purpose" : "This game-like interactive web app is intended to serve as assistive material for learning / training purposes regarding the study and analysis of two parallel sorting algorithms for two-dimensional meshes, i.e., the Shearsort algorithm and the '3n sort' algorithm suggested by Schnorr and Shamir."
